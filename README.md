# Wordle
A console-based implementation of a popular word-guessing game
Players have six chances to guess a randomly selected five-letter word. As shown above,
You can enter a total of six words, meaning you can enter five burner words from which you can learn hints about the letters and their placements. Then you get one chance to put those hints to use. Or you can try for performance and guess the word of the day in three, two or even one go.
